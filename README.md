# kindergartenmathgame1
This is a very, very simple Bash script for kindergarten students learning to compare numbers. In this script, it is assumed the students are holding cards with 2 numbers to compare. This script does not generate random numbers just to make sure the students are physically connected to the numbers they are comparing.
